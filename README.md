<!-- You can find the organizations profile and application guidelines [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/4945163270488064/). -->
[List of the project ideas is available on the Jenkins website](https://jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2021/project-ideas/).
The Jenkins organisation is currently looking for project ideas and mentors. Find more information on suggesting project ideas or voluntering as a mentor in [this Jenkins blog post](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/12/16/call-for-mentors/).

Jenkins holds GSoC Office Hours every week on Wednesdays, see [the Jenkins event calendar](https://www.jenkins.io/events/). You can view past [GSoC Office Hours on our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN7ajX_VdyaO1f6bvkcSzW4PdWKkLktRG).
And read our [GSoC Office Hours meeting minutes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H0gJt1zdr37YDpuSLXSeFqYco_a_CIrAuZ1f0Oyl4XE/edit#) -- these contain a lot of advice on getting started as a potential GSoC student, as well as discussions on proposed project ideas.
