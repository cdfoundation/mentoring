## Ortelius

Ortelius is a microservice management platform that integrates into CI/CD to perform automated configuration management, versioning and tracking of microservices and other cloud native components providing visibility before you deploy.  This year Ortelius will participate in GSOC with 3 projects, two focused on interoperability and one around data visualization. 

Project Description:
- Spinnaker and ArgoCD - add integration to allow [Spinnaker](https://github.com/ortelius/ortelius/issues/105) and [ArgoCD](https://github.com/ortelius/ortelius/issues/215) to call Ortelius for updating deployment configuration data and relationships.
- [Relationship Visualization](https://github.com/ortelius/ortelius/issues/216). Research and implement updates to the Ortelius Visualization Maps to expand the data for Domains, Component Blast Radius and Application Bill of Material reports.

Recommended Skills: 
- Javascript
- Java
- Python

### Tekton

Tekton is a set of shared, open source components for building CI/CD systems. It modernizes the Continuous Delivery control plane and moves the brains of software deployment to Kubernetes. Tektonâ€™s goal is to provide industry specifications for CI/CD pipelines, workflows and other building blocks through a vendor neutral, open source foundation. The Tekton Pipelines project provides Kubernetes-style resources for declaring CI/CD-style pipelines.
